pmdsky-debug-py
===============

Autogenerated and statically check-able pmdsky-debug_ symbol definitions
for Python.

The actual package is in ``src``.

Do not edit the contents of the package, since they are autogenerated using a
Github action and the generator, which is in ``generator``.

To use the symbols in your projects, you can install the package from PyPi::

    pip install pmdsky-debug-py

Symbols are grouped by regions. Each region implements the
``pmdsky_debug_py.SymbolsProtocol``.

To get a symbol, you can query it like this::

    pmdsky_debug_py.eu.functions.InitMemAllocTable.address

See the source code and the symbol definitions of pmdsky-debug_ for more information.

Versions
--------

A new release is generated daily from the last available release of pmdsky-debug_.
The versions of ``pmdsky-debug-py`` transform the base release of pmdsky-debug_ like such::

    0.2.1 -> 2.1.x
    1.3.1 -> 1003.1.x

*x* is replaced with an incremental number for each incremental release.
To get the corresponding ``pmdsky-debug`` version, check the release on Github and/or the
``pmdsky_debug_py.RELEASE`` constant.

To explain this further:
``pmdsky-debug`` uses incremental release in the form of ``0.2.1+6fcd501bde``.
To publish on PyPi, this needs to be converted to a proper semantic non-dev version, so we just count
up instead.

The version in ``src`` will also always match with the submodule in ``pmdsky-debug``.
